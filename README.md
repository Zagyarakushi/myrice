# üìñ Installation
------------

You will need some programs to be installed for the full experience (will be added in the future) but not having a program intalled should not cause any problems.


# üìù Usage
-----

Now go to the directory and copy the required files to the appropriate place. Or copy the entire thing to /home/$USER/ for authentic experience.
Make sure to restart the computer afterwards.
